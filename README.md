# Data Analytics Files Project

Welcome to the **Data Analytics Files Project**. This repository is a curated collection of data analytics files, focusing on the Superstore dataset to illustrate comprehensive data analysis, manipulation, and visualization processes. Aimed at data enthusiasts and analysts at various levels, this project covers everything from raw data handling in Excel to sophisticated visual analysis in Tableau, alongside SQL queries for data manipulation and extraction.

## Project Overview

This project encapsulates a series of step-by-step analytical processes applied to the Superstore dataset. It includes raw data files, processed Excel workbooks, SQL scripts for detailed querying, and Tableau workbooks for advanced data visualization. The goal is to provide a holistic view of the data analytics workflow, showcasing practical applications of Excel, SQL, and Tableau in extracting insights from complex datasets.
